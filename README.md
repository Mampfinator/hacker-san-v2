# Hacker-san V2
The long-awaited and completely overdue improved notification bot for [PRISMCord](https://discord.gg/prismworld) - now with slash commands and 7% less jank.

## Features
- Live/Schedule/Upload/Offline notifications for YouTube & Twitter (with more planned!), along with community posts for YouTube
- An over-designed but at the very least working slash command loader.

## Self-hosting
Remove the `.example` from **.env.example** and **config.example.toml** and fill out the fields accordingly.

Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Start: 
```
npm start
```

For YouTube & Twitcasting, you'll need to expose an external IP/adress for WebHook messages. This is configurable in your **config.toml**.

## Contributing
*Good luck*. I am open to PRs & issues tho. If you run into problems or have questions, you can find me on PRISMcord as Sir Eatsalot.
