# Hacker-san V2
The long-awaited and completely overdue improved notification bot for PRISMCord - now with slash commands and 7% less jank.

## Features
- Live/Schedule/Upload/Offline notifications for YouTube & Twitter (with more planned!), along with community posts for YouTube

## Self-hosting
Remove the `.example` from **.env.example** and **config.example.toml** and fill out the fields accordingly.

Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Start: 
```
npm start
```

For YouTube & Twitcasting, you'll need to expose an external IP/adress for WebHook messages. This is configurable in your **config.toml**.

## Contributing
*Good luck*.
